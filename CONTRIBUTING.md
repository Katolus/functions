# Contributing to `functions-cli`

Since this is young and heavily self-developed repository, all the contributions are going to have to account for that.
Expect changes to be made quickly. Don't get used to a code structure until a first stable release. 

If **anyone** wants to contributed regardless of that, please feel free to pickup/create an issue, drop a discussion post. 

Share your ideas and let us make something out of nothing. 


## Pull Request Process

To be researched. Please submit your pull request and we will try to figure out what is the best form.


## Coding conventions

We are using `black` for formatting and looking for extra tools to automate.
