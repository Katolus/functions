This section includes background on how we administrate our `functions` project. We hope that the information noted here brings peace and trust in using the tool.

You might even like it so much that you decide to help out!

## The Origins

We created `functions` to address the accumulating difficulty in building features in an event ecosystem (PubSub). It started as a side project, meant to satisfy minimal requirements of being useful in the shortest time. With time it evolved to an open-source level aspiration. A swing at building a tool, used and contributed to by many.

## Maintenance

These are early days, and the project is at its infant years. It lacks structure, resources and a tested sense of purpose. Hopefully, it will gain these over time. **It is maintained on a casual basis, addressing issues here and there as the motivation comes in**.

If the project proves to be redundant, it will be abandoned to make space for other, more capable projects.

So if you are using `functions` and don't want to lose it, head to any resources and show your appreciation. It will give us so much required **motivation** and keep us going.

## Governance

All final decisions, features and future focus are made by [Piotr Katolik], the architect of this project.
