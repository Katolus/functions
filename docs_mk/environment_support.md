Due to limited amount of resources and a narrow development scope, `functions` are available/working on a limited subset of environments (OS + runtime).

## Operating systems

| OS name       | Status    | Was tested?  |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Ubuntu(Linux) | Available | Yes          |
| macOS         | Available | Yes - Mildly |
| Windows       | Unknown   | No           |

## Programming languages and runtime versions

**TBU**: "Functions" managed by the `functions` package are run by docker and therefore require a set of files to support it's execution.
One of this files is the `Dockerfile` which can be written or generated. Generation is limited to what is currently implemented.

| Language | Status    | Version | Was tested? |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Python   | Available |         | Yes         |
| Node     |           |         |             |
| Java     |           |         |             |
| Go       |           |         |             |
