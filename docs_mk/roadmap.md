To understand what this project is about, check out the idea section. Currently, the `functions` project is curated by the author, so please consider contributing. All input is welcomed.
The main goal is to provide a valuable, tested, and robust tool that others can use to their benefit. You can follow a more detailed, documented path via the project [page](https://github.com/users/Katolus/projects/1).

Once we reach the base quality and the project gets traction, we plan to grow its capabilities. Topics/features include:

## Short-term Projects

* Add AWS support.
* Add support for GitHub URL as a source path for a function.
* Enhance support for runtimes other than python.
* Custom commands and scripts.
* Initialise and lead test coverage.


## Mid-term Projects

* **Docker image** - An attempt to wrap all the necessary parts into an extensible docker image than anyone can use in there cloud and local development projects.

And more to come as the tool starts to get used in actual implementations.
