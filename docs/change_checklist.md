# Change checklist

Is a document that holds a list of questions that need to be answered before implementing a given functionality. We use them to gauge if a given change is inline with project's [values](./project_proposal.md#values).

## Checklist

- [] Is the complexity (amount of steps/time) increased after that this change?
- [] Does this change require any actions from the user?
- How does this change influence local and distributed systems (single and more than one machine scope)?
