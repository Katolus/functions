# `development` as default branch 

The idea behind this decision is a attempt to create a more accessible development stream. 

A vision that the `master` branch should be focused on the valuable releases associate with package versions. 

All the tooling that needs to be run to enforce quality should be associated with the `master` branch. 

The `master` branch should be protected.

All this should enable a more flexible work around smaller issues in a singular pool of developer(s). 

All the PRs should target the `development` branch as base and a release PR should be a combination of sub PRs on a per ready basis.
