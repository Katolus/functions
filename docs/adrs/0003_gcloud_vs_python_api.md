# `gcloud` vs GCP's Python APIs

## Problem statement

In order to work with GCP, we need to find a way of interacting with GCP resources. There are two know ways of doing that. One way is to use the `gcloud` tool. A command line tool that can be used to interact with GCP via a terminal. Second way is to use GCP's Python API libraries. A set of libraries developed by Google to make it possible to interact with GCP's components from a python scope.

## Attempt

History attempt on using the libraries.
