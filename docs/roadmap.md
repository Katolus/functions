# `functions-cli` Roadmap

To get an understanding of what this project is meant to achive look into the [project proposal](./docs/proposal/) document. As of current, the `functions-cli` project is driven by me and only me, however more contributions are welcomed. 

Main goal at the moment is to provide a vialable, tested, and robust software project that other can use to their benefit. This effort is summarised under the project name of ["Primary"](https://github.com/users/Katolus/projects/1).

These are the other topics/features in the future scope:

- Add AWS support.
- Add support for github URL as source of a function.
- Initialise and lead test coverage.
- Enhance support for runtimes other than python.

With more to come as the project starts getting ground in real implementations.
