# Support

Due to the early and small size of the project, the support that might be possible is minimal. 

We hope to develop a community of people that helps each other out, so if you have any questions, please head to the Q&A section [here](https://github.com/Katolus/functions/discussions/categories/q-a).

If you are facing a problem that is not answered by the Q&A section, create an issue and don't forget to follow the prepared templates. 

We build our software to make your life easier, so don't hesitate to ask and contribute. You will be surprised how open and supportive are people who enjoy what they are doing!
