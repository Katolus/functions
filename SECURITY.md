## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please refrain from posting it straight away. 

To best address and contain a possible issue, it needs a review before making it public. 

Of course, we cannot wait too long, and people need to know if their environments are compromised. So please consider all options.

From our side, we ask for **7 days** of extra time before announcing to address said problems most delicately. 

Please report the discovered vulnerabilities to this [email](mailto:katolus.work@gmail.com).
